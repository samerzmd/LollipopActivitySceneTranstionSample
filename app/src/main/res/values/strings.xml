    <string name="action_settings">Settings</string>
    <string name="the_blues_name">THE BLUES</string>
    <string name="the_blues_role">AKA the Blues! These fun-loving and mischievous little birds are identical triplets with identical personalities. But don’t tell them that – they get very upset when the birds can’t tell them apart! Jay has a hidden feather on his back that’s a darker shade of blue. And Jake has a slightly better sense of smell. So you see, completely different!</string>
    <string name="chuck_name">CHUCK</string>
    <string name="chuck_role">Chuck likes to do everything at 100 miles-per-hour. Why do things slowly and properly when you can do them quickly and carelessly? So he does the dishes in half the time, but with only half the dishes unbroken! And sleep? That just gets in the way of doing stuff. Each night he falls asleep accidentally after tiring himself out too much. I’m not tired…I’m not tired…ZZZZZZZZZZZ</string>
    <string name="bomb_name">BOMB</string>
    <string name="bomb_role">Bomb’s main goal in life is to have fun. Everything else just gets in the way! Strategy meetings and chores – not so much fun. Blowing things up and playing tricks – now that’s more like it! He’s a relaxed fun-loving bird who’s always joking around with those mischievous Blues. So just imagine what the super-serious Red thinks of Bomb’s wacky and carefree antics!</string>
    <string name="matilda_name">MATILDA</string>
    <string name="matilda_role">Matilda’s the Mother Hen of the flock who sees the birds as her own little hatchlings – all needing her constant care and attention. She likes to fuss over the other birdies to make sure they eat their vegetables and go to bed on time. In Matilda’s mind the whole flock loves it when she interferes in every part of their lives. Who wouldn’t appreciate that? Well, it turns out everyone!</string>
    <string name="bubbles_name">BUBBLES</string>
    <string name="bubbles_role">Bubbles is an odd little bird that’s perfectly happy eating tasty treats all day long. Chocolate, sweeties, ice cream, doughnuts, candy canes – you name it, he’ll eat it. Oh, you have your own candy and decide to hide it? Don’t bother, he’ll find it! He’d happily travel across the island if he thought a packet of chewy sweets was waiting for him. So I guess the point is he likes candy!</string>
    <string name="stella_name">STELLA</string>
    <string name="stella_role">Stella’s the star of the show and the bird all the others look up to. She may look cute and cuddly, but don’t be fooled – if you push her too far, she’ll soon reveal her blazing-hot temper! That’s just how she rolls, sweet on the outside and fierce on the inside.</string>
    <string name="red_name">RED</string>
    <string name="red_role">Red’s special skills are his leadership qualities, which at first seems feeble compared to the brute force of Terence or explosive power of Bomb. But wait! Someone has to organize this odd flock of birds! He’s also a bit highly strung and sees small things as a declaration of war – like hearing the sound of the wind and thinking it’s the battle cry of the pig army. So that’s kind of intense!</string>
